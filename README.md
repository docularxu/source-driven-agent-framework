# 🔬 Source-Driven Code Analysis Multi-Agent Framework

A multi-agent framework designed for deep code reverse engineering and architecture analysis.

In software development, we use Spec-Driven agents to write code. But in reverse engineering and source code analysis, we need **Source-Driven** agents - where the source code itself is the single source of truth.

This framework introduces **"No Evidence, No Claim"** and **anti-Analysis Hypnosis** mechanisms to tackle million-line-scale C/C++ system code analysis.

Looking for code **development** instead of analysis? Check out [agent-TRIO](https://github.com/docularxu/agent-TRIO) - same team structure, but for spec-driven software development. **No Doc, No Code** instead of No Evidence, No Claim.

## 🌟 Core Design Principles

1. **No Evidence, No Claim**: Every business logic assertion must be accompanied by a precise physical code reference `[file:line]`. No reference, no claim.

2. **Zero-Trust Review**: The Reviewer agent verifies code citations by going back to the source code and checking the actual lines referenced. No claim is accepted at face value.

3. **Progressive Knowledge Graph**: Instead of single-pass large-context reads, the framework uses a shared blackboard (`tasks-backlog` + `knowledge-map`) to progressively piece together the global architecture, module by module.

4. **Blackboard State Machine**: All workflow progression is driven by file-based state tags (`[TODO]` → `[Analyzing]` → `[Reviewing]` → `[Done]`), not by agent memory. This enables crash recovery and deterministic flow control.

## 👥 The Agent Team

A "permanent team, rotating projects" approach - the agents persist across projects, accumulating expertise over time.

- **⚡ Jarvis-Arch (Architect)**: Scouts the codebase, splits modules, controls token budget, manages the knowledge graph, and arbitrates conflicts. Drives the state machine.

- **🔬 Researcher (Code Archaeologist)**: Traces call chains, tracks data flow mutations, reports implicit jumps (`[UNRESOLVED]`). Believes only in what the compiler executes, not what comments say.

- **🔍 Reviewer (Logic Judge)**: Assumes all reports contain hallucinations until proven otherwise. Uses reverse verification, shadow tracking, and context toxicity checks to catch errors.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) installed and running (`openclaw gateway start`)
- An LLM provider configured (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, etc.)

There are two ways to deploy:

**Option A: Let your AI agent do it.** Clone this repo, then tell your existing AI agent:

> "Read the README and configs at `~/source-driven-agent-framework/`. Set up the three agents (Jarvis-Arch, Researcher, Reviewer) with their SOUL.md files, configure communication, and verify everything works."

Your agent reads this repo, executes all the steps below, and reports back. You describe the intent, the agent handles the rest. This is how deployment works in the AI agent era.

**Option B: Do it yourself.** The detailed steps below are written so that either an AI agent or a human can follow them. If you prefer hands-on control, or if your agent needs a reference, here they are:

### 1. Deploy the Prompts

Clone this repo. Copy each agent's `SOUL.md` into their OpenClaw workspace:

```bash
# Create agents
openclaw agents add jarvis-arch --model <your-model-id>
openclaw agents add researcher --model <your-model-id>
openclaw agents add reviewer --model <your-model-id>

# Install SOUL.md
cp agents/jarvis-arch/SOUL.md ~/.openclaw/agents/jarvis-arch/SOUL.md
cp agents/researcher/SOUL.md  ~/.openclaw/agents/researcher/SOUL.md
cp agents/reviewer/SOUL.md    ~/.openclaw/agents/reviewer/SOUL.md
```

See `configs/openclaw-example.yaml` for a full configuration example with tool permissions.

### 2. Verify Agent Communication

Before starting real work, run a quick smoke test to confirm all three agents can talk to each other:

```
You → Jarvis-Arch:  "Ping Researcher and Reviewer, confirm communication."
```

Expected result:
- Jarvis-Arch sends a message to Researcher → Researcher acknowledges
- Jarvis-Arch sends a message to Reviewer → Reviewer acknowledges
- Jarvis-Arch reports back: "All agents online, communication verified."

If any link fails, check `subagents.allowAgents` in your OpenClaw config (see `configs/openclaw-example.yaml`).

### 3. Start Analyzing

Point Jarvis-Arch to a source code project (an existing local clone or a GitHub repo URL):

> "Analyze the dummy-c-project at example_workspace/dummy-c-project/. Focus on tracing the init flow in main() to find out which hardware register address is actually being operated on."

Jarvis-Arch will handle the rest (Phase 1 - Reconnaissance):
1. Align the analysis scope with you through conversation
2. Initialize the workspace using templates (`PROJECT.md`, `.blackboard/`, etc.)
3. Scout the codebase, produce `PROJECT.md` + `SYMBOL_INDEX.md`
4. Submit the plan to Reviewer, then ask you for sign-off

After sign-off, Phase 2 begins automatically:
5. Dispatch modules to Researcher, trigger Reviewer for verification
6. Integrate results into `knowledge-map.md`

> **Tip**: Templates in `templates/` are reference copies. You can also manually initialize a workspace with `cp -r templates/blackboard/ .blackboard/` if you prefer hands-on setup.

### 4. See It in Action

`example_workspace/dummy-c-project/` contains a 3-file C project with deliberate traps (function pointer dispatch, macro obfuscation, dead code). Point your agents at it and run the full workflow.

After your agents finish, compare your results against `example_output/dummy-c-project/` - the reference output from a real live-fire exercise.

## 💡 Experience Accumulation

"Permanent team, rotating projects." When a project wraps up, don't delete the agents. Append lessons learned to each agent's `MEMORY.md` (SOUL.md is read-only - only the human owner modifies it). Your team gets sharper with every project.

## Three-Phase Workflow

![Three-Phase Analysis Flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd2fc060-7bdf-4039-897f-0ca1420db382)

| Phase | Input | Output | Gate |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| **1. Reconnaissance** | Analysis target + codebase access | PROJECT.md, tasks-backlog.md, knowledge-map.md (initial), SYMBOL_INDEX.md | Reviewer pass + Owner sign-off |
| **2. Deep Dive** (per module) | task.md + knowledge-map + source code | analysis/NN-module.md, review.md, knowledge-map (updated) | Reviewer pass (≤3 rounds) |
| **3. Final Report** | All analysis/*.md + knowledge-map (final) | REPORT.md | Owner sign-off |

## Origin

This framework was designed through a collaboration between a human (20+ years kernel dev) and AI agents. The core insight: **AI analyzing code without evidence constraints produces plausible-sounding hallucinations. Force every claim to carry a `[file:line]` reference, add zero-trust review, and analysis quality transforms.**
